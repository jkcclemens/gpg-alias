# gpg-alias

Store aliases to PGP keys.

## Alias signing

If alias signing is enabled, each alias added will have a signature generated by your default PGP
key. On running, gpg-alias will check the signature to make sure that it matches what the alias is
configured as in the config file. If a discrepancy is detected, gpg-alias will return
unsuccessfully.

Note that if an alias is added to the config file and there is no signature, gpg-alias will prompt
for user input before generating a signature. To fail without a signature, run in non-interactive
mode.

Further note that non-interactive mode doesn't exist yet.
